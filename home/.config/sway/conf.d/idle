# Example configuration:

exec swayidle -w \
    timeout 900 'swaylock -f -c 000000' \
    timeout 900 'swaymsg "output * power off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * power on"' \
    before-sleep 'swaylock -f --show-keyboard-layout --indicator-caps-lock -c 000000'

# This will lock your screen after 900 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.
